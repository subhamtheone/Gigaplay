This repo is part of Git Integration & Wix CLI, a set of tools that allows you to write, test, and publish code for your Wix site locally on your computer. 

Connect your site to GitHub, develop in your favorite IDE, test your code in real time, and publish your site from the command line.

## Set up this repository in your IDE
This repo is connected to a Wix site. That site tracks this repo's default branch. Any code committed and pushed to that branch from your local IDE appears on the site.

Before getting started, make sure you have the following things installed:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 14.8 or later.
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* An SSH key [added to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

To set up your local environment and start coding locally, do the following:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to store the repo.
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone <your-repository-url>`.
1. Navigate to the repo's directory by running `cd <directory-name>`.
1. Install the repo's dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
1. Install the Wix CLI by running `npm install -g @wix/cli` or `yarn global add @wix/cli`.
